## Support 
The macOS and Linux machines are managed by Computer Science Support (CS Support). If you have a problem with a machine, please contact CS Suport by email [cs-support@aber.ac.uk](mailto:cs-support@aber.ac.uk). Tell them which machine you are working on; you can find that information on the machine.
