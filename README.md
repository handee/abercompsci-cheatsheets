A set of quick guides for using the Linux and Mac OS X machines in the Aberystwyth Computer Science department. All students and staff in the department are able to use the Linux machines in the Delphinium and the OS X machines in the Orchard. 

## OS X (Orchard)
The following information is relevant for users of OS X El Capitan. 

* [Launching Applications](mac/launch.md) - Launchpad, Terminal (command line), Spotlight.
* Apple [Keyboard basics](mac/keyboard.md) - Cmd, #, Ctrl, Option.

* [Terminal](mac/terminal.md) command line operation - including access to the Console. 
    * General Unix terminal commands (see [bash.md](bash.md)).

## Support 
The OS X and Linux machines are managed by Computer Science Support (CS Support). If you have a problem with a machine, please contact CS Suport by email [cs-support@aber.ac.uk](mailto:cs-support@aber.ac.uk) or go to the office FIXME in the Computer Science building. Tell them which machine you are working on; you can find that information FIXME. 

You can also ask for help via the [Aber Comp Sci Q & A Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/acs.qa/) group.
