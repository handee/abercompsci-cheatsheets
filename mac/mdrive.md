# Mounting a drive on Mac OS X
The iMac machines in the Orchard already have your IMPACS filestore attached. Therefore, you do not need to mount the this drive to the machine. However, if you need to mount a drive from a different machine, or mount your IS filestore, follow these instructions. 

## Mounting 
1. Open **Finder** by clicking on its icon on the far left of the
Dock, at the bottom of the screen

2. Open the **Go** menu at the top of the screen, and click **Connect
to Server**

3. To mount a case-sensitive version of your IS filestore, enter `smb://your_username@smb1.aber.ac.uk/cshome` and click **Connect**.
The contents of your `M:` drive should then appear

4. To access your directory later on, open Finder again and look for
`smb1.aber.ac.uk` in the sidebar

## Case Insensitive .. 
Note: you can use an alternative URL for accessing your IS filestore. It is `smb://smb1.aber.ac.uk/your_username`. However, this version is **not** case sensitive.
